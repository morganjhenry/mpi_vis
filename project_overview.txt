This project's goal was to investigate how different variables regarding MPI
affect the time it takes to run. There are four different MPI protocols: hybrid,
mvapich, recv and postcopy. This data shows which protocol is fastest when different
situations occer.

rsleep is the length of calculation done by the receiver and ssleep is length of
calculation done by the sender. We learned the fastest protocol does not change
when ssleep==10, rsleep==500 and ssleep==500 and rsleep==10 when the buffersize 
is large. However, there is a difference in the fastest protocol when buffer sizes
are small, however the speed up is not large enough to make much of an impact. 

This data does show that increasing the power cap does speed up the run time which 
is what we expected. When buffer size is larger changing the power cap does not
change which protocol is faster. With smaller buffersizes power cap can change which
protocol is faster, however, like sleep values its speed up isn't enough to make a 
large impact.
